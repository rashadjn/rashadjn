## Hi, I’m Rashad 👋
I’m a Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo with a strong interest in building reliable, production-grade software and applied AI systems.

I enjoy working on backend platforms, AI tooling, and data-driven systems, especially where software operates at real-world scale.
